Note:
CI/CD:: Jenkins,Github Actions,Gitlab CI/CD anything are heart of the Automatic Deployment process
For every commit,it will automatically and run the pipeline
Pipeline might contain : Security,SonarQube,artifactory,Test etc..we can create..
So without CI/CD it will be a manual deployment
Git -->Docker-->kubernetes

For kubernetes Security below Tools will be using:
